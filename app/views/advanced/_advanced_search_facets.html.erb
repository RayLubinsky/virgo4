  # From the original template:
  #
  # Used to render facets with checkboxes on advanced search form, we pretty
  # much just use the built-in blacklight render_facet_partials helper.
  #
  # But we've provided a local override of the _facet_limit partial in our own
  # `views/advanced/_facet_limit.html.erb`, that is written to include
  # checkboxes for form selection.
  #
  # This is the default display of facets, but you can also choose to use
  # _advanced_search_facets_as_select, for a chosen.js-compatible multi-select.
